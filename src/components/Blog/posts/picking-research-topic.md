# Picking a Research Topic

Choosing the right research topic is one of the most important parts of doing a PhD.
Here’s how I think about it:

---

## 1. Curiosity > Trends  
A topic should come from a deep question you want answered.

## 2. Choose a problem, not a dataset  
Real research solves real constraints.

## 3. Track the gaps in literature  
The easiest way to publish is to fill a missing piece.
